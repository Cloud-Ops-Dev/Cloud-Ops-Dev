# I'm Cloud-Ops-Dev! ☁️🚀

DevOps ninja specializing in cloud ops, infrastructure as code, IaaS, SaaS, Process/Project management and fixing what breaks. Currently job-hunting for roles where I can deploy magic and squash bugs.

## Skills That Slay
- **Cloud Arsenal**: AWS (EC2, S3 mastery), Terraform for IaC, Docker for container chaos control.
- **Epic Win Highlight**: Troubleshot Terraform deployment errors like a boss – fixed S3 bucket naming with lowercase random strings and resolved Docker port conflicts by reassigning ports. Teamed it up with an EC2 instance via .pem key for bulletproof access. (Repo demo below!)
- **Tech Stack**: Python, Bash, Git, CI/CD – plus a sixth sense for debugging.
- **Fun Fact**: I once fixed a deploy while dodging rain – clouds in the sky, clouds in the code. 🌧️

## Projects Spotlight
- **[Terraform Troubleshooting Repo](https://github.com/Cloud-Ops-Dev/your-terraform-repo)**: Dive into the code for my real-world fixes. Screenshots, steps, and .pem key vibes included (anonymized, obvs).
